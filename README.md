# Hey there! I'm Nico! üëã

I'm a Software Engineer, QA Engineer, and educator with a passion for quality and continuous learning. I love building things‚Äîwhether it's code, curriculum, or testing strategies. My experience in program management and education brings a user-centered perspective to everything I create and test. I'm always exploring new tech and sharing knowledge along the way. Let's build something cool together, or just connect!
