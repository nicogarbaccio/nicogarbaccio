# Hey there! I'm Nico! 👋

I'm a QA Engineer & code tinkerer obsessed with quality. I build constantly—exploring tech, honing skills, and applying learnings through rigorous manual testing and smart automation. My background as an educator and program manager gives me a uniquely user-first testing mindset. Let's build something cool together, or just connect!

## Some of my recent personal projects

### 🏨 [LetMeBook](https://github.com/nicogarbaccio/hotel-booking-app) // A hotel-booking platform inspired by Booking.com
LetMeBook is a full-stack hotel booking app using the MERN stack. The frontend is powered by Vite and is written entirely in TypeScript. The backend is fueled by Express and Node.js, while MongoDB is used for the database. Additionally, the app features a comprehensive suite of end-to-end tests written in Playwright, covering everything from authentication to booking a hotel, ensuring rock-solid reliability and a seamless user experience.

**Note: The site is deployed on Render, so it may take a minute to spin up, as it sometimes needs to rebuild.**
