## Hey there! I'm Nico! üëã

I'm a full stack developer and recent graduate of Flatiron School. Before pivoting to the tech world I spent 6 years in the nonprofit education space, designing and managing successful youth literacy and technology programs. I'm a strong collaborator and problem-solver with program management and process-improvement expertise. I'm passionate about community, learning and teaching. I'm quick to pick up new technologies and programming languages, and have a knack for explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences. I‚Äôm excited to join a team where I can continue to learn and grow while building creative and innovative products. 

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently building a live messaging app (essentially a lightweight Slack clone) to then be incorporated into ExplorED, my e-learning app.  
- üå± I‚Äôm also diving deeper into learning SQL as well as learning AWS and Python
- üí¨ Talk to me about hockey, video games, Jeopardy, and weird New Jersey lore
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him

### Some of my recent projects
[Slouch](https://slouch-dd087.web.app/)
- [Live Site](https://slouch-dd087.web.app/)
Slouch is a single-page, lightweight version of the messaging app Slack. I built the front end with React and Redux, while the backend is powered by     Firebase, where it's also deployed. While I knew React already, I wanted to use new libraries while I built this, and doing so really showed me the power of Redux and Firebase (and Firebase hooks), as well as how easy styling becomes with Styled Components. I took advantage of Firebase hooks to support channel creation and provide Google authentication, which makes logging in unbelievably easy, quick, and secure. Redux fit in perfectly with the app, allowing users to seamlessly move from channel to channel. Last but not least, Styled Components and Material UI were used to create a sleek user interface that looks pretty close to the real Slack. While this is still a work in progress (I'm currently working on implementing DMs), I'm really happy with how clean and easy to read this code is. 

üè´ [ExplorED](https://github.com/nicogarbaccio/explored): An e-learning app that allows instructors to share materials with students, create discussions, and more.  
- [Live Site](https://explored.onrender.com) | [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/8da5fe90c42d495d924c220ce23c1f81)
ExplorED is an e-learning app that that makes it easy for instructors to share materials, create discussions, and more with students. I built this app for my capstone project at Flatiron School. Having a background in education and having used multiple platforms as a teacher and as a student, this is something I've wanted to build for a while. I built it solo and from scratch, so I'm pretty proud of it! It's got a React front end and a Rails back end. I customized a database schema using Postgres and implemented the MVC pattern in Ruby on Rails, which made the app scalable and efficient. To allow for file management, I integrated ActiveStorage, which enables instructors to upload materials and students to download them. For user authentication, I utilized BCrypt, which allows for different levels of authorization for instructors and student. And finally, I styled the app using Tailwind CSS, which makes it look great and easy to navigate (I especially love how the dropdown came out). 

üé∂ [Groovehound](https://github.com/nicogarbaccio/groovehound): A concert tracking website which allows users to easily find upcoming concerts and record the ones they‚Äôve been to.
- [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/98d9737320164a4db5673c7f81a60d64)
Groovehound is a concert tracking website which allows users to easily find upcoming concerts and keep a record of the ones they've been to. It's got a React front end and a Rails back end. This was my first project built on Rails and PostgreSQL, and it really showed me the power of Rails associations, BCrypt, and building reusable components. My teammates and I built the database using PostgreSQL, which made it easy to create and store data about users, bands, concerts, and venues (and we had a lot of it). My favorite feature that I built is the For You feature, which utilizes the data to show upcoming concerts in the state and/or city that the user lives in and matches with genres or bands the user likes. It also allows the user to explore all upcoming concerts outside of their city and state.
