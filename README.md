# Hey there! I'm Nico! 👋

I'm a QA Engineer & code tinkerer obsessed with quality. I build constantly—exploring tech, honing skills, and applying learnings through rigorous manual testing and smart automation. My background as an educator and program manager gives me a uniquely user-first testing mindset. Let's build something cool together, or just connect!
