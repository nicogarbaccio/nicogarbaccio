# Hey there! I'm Nico! 👋

I'm a QA Engineer, code tinkerer, and educator currently working as a Test Engineer at BetMGM. I love building things—whether it's code, curriculum, or testing strategies. My experience in program management and education brings a user-centered perspective to everything I create and test. I'm always exploring new tech and sharing knowledge along the way. Let's build something cool together, or just connect!
